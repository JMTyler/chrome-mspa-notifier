MSPA Update Notifier
Chrome Extension

This extension will check mspaintadventures.com once every five minutes
to see if there are any updates.  (Currently every 5s for testing.)

The default icon for the button is the classic :mspa: face.  If something
goes wrong, it will show the classic MSPA stick figure looking at his :gun:.
If there are updates, the icon will be a :pumpkin: and will show a count in the
bottom corner showing how many updates have arrived.

Clicking the button will always take you to the last MSPA page you have read.
This is even the case if there are updates, because it gives you context by reminding
you what you read last.  I always start this way.  Maybe it'll be configurable later.
