MSPA Notifier
Chrome Extension

This extension will check mspaintadventures.com once every five minutes
to see if there are any updates.

The default icon for the button is the classic :mspa: face.  If there are
updates, the icon will be a :pumpkin: and will show a count of how many
updates have arrived in the bottom corner.

Clicking the button will always take you to the last MSPA page you have read.
This is even the case if there are updates, because it gives you context by reminding
you what you read last.  I always start this way.  Maybe it'll be configurable later.
